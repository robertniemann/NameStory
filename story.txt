Once there was a boy named Erik. He wanted to grow to be a Cleric. His mom said "that's barbaric". Erik then changed his name to Derek.

After Erik changed his name to Derek, Derek decided to persue his passion for Clericism. However, the College of Clericism in Winterhold had strict academic prerequisites. One of these included learning the ancient Clericish tome "Healing Hands" and performing.  

This was a problem for Derek.  The Healing Hands tome was written in an ancient language that he did not know. Derek really wanted to go to the College of Clericism but did not know what to do.

Luckily there was an old woman in a nearby village that would teach Derek all about the alphanumerics of Clericish, for a pound of tum-ER-ic. Undaunted, he went in search of a place where it grew that was not 'too barbaric'.

After an eternity of searching, Derek finally came across the Tumeric field, brought a pound to the woman. He learned the ancient language, went to college, did all his homework, and became a cleric. The end.

once there was a boy named Erik. He wanted to grow to be a Cleric. His mom said "that's barbaric". Erik then changed his name to Derek.

After Erik changed his name to Derek, Derek decided to persue his passion for Clericism. However, the College of Clericism in Winterhold had strict academic prerequisites. One of these included learning the ancient Clericish tome "Healing Hands" and performing.
